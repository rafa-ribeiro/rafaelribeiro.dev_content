## Trying to keep a blog, I hope

##### Hi everyone, how are you doing?

<br/>

I hope everyone is staying safe and doing well, my name is Rafael, and here I'm like an attempt to make 
and (which I consider more difficult) to maintain a personal blog. In 2022 I will complete 10 years as a 
software developer, so my idea is to use this space to share some stuff that I had an opportunity to learn in this 
period, studying a lot and working with incredible people.
<br/><br/>

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from PUC-SP and I'm graduated in the Software Engineering specialization
course from Unicamp. I'm working for almost 10 years as a software engineer, which 8 of them as Java Developer mainly 
and more recently I'm working with Python (and I have liked it a lot üòç), so maybe these programming languages can
appear more frequently here, but I like so many others topics like algorithms, problems solving, data structures, 
learn new technologies and I intend to write about these topics here as well
<br/><br/>

Now I'm working with an incredible team at [Viva Decora](https://github.com/vivadecora) as a backend tech lead. Further, I love music, from any style and
I try to play acoustic guitar at some parties with my friends, I love to play soccer, I'm a supporter of the best soccer
team in Brazil a.k.a S√£o Paulo Futebol Clube (üôÉü§°) and I love to play chess as well, although I'm not a good one.
<br/><br/>

Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelribeir0/) or email (_me [at]
rafaelribeiro.dev_) in case you want to chat about any of these topics. See you!
<br/><br/>

**P.S.:** _Another purpose for this blog is forcing me to write more in a different language and try to improve my 
English skills, said that sorry for my written mistakes since now, I hope to achieve more fluency writing in English 
soon and to deliver useful and good tech content for you. Best_
